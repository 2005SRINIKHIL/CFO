## API Integration

### OpenAI Integration
The platform integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide intelligent financial analysis:

```typescript
interface FinancialSummary {
  totalRevenue: number;
  totalExpenses: number;
  cashBurn: number;
  runway: number;
  growthRate: number;
  revenueStreams: RevenueStream[];
  teamSize: number;
  companyName: string;
  industry: string;
}
```

### Firebase Firestore Schema
```typescript
// User Profile Collection
user_profiles/{userId}: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  role: string;
  companyName: string;
  companySize: string;
  industry: string;
  created_at: Timestamp;
  updated_at: Timestamp;
}

// Financial Data Collection
financial_data/{userId}: {
  monthlyRevenue: number;
  monthlyExpenses: number;
  currentCash: number;
  growthRate: number;
  teamSize: number;
  averageSalary: number;
  marketingBudget: number;
  operationalExpenses: number;
  updated_at: Timestamp;
}

// Revenue Streams Subcollection
revenue_streams/{userId}/streams/{streamId}: {
  name: string;
  type: 'subscription' | 'one-time' | 'usage-based' | 'commission';
  monthlyRevenue: number;
  customers: number;
  averageValue: number;
  growthRate: number;
  color: string;
  created_at: Timestamp;
}
```

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify Node.js version compatibility
node --version
npm --version
```

**Performance Issues**
- Enable browser developer tools for performance profiling
- Check network tab for slow API calls
